# Body Fat Prediction Web Application 

Body Fat Predictor is a web application built with React and FastAPI that estimates an individualâ€™s body fat percentage based on key body measurements such as age, weight, height, and various circumference values. 
The app uses a machine learning model trained on a cleaned Kaggle dataset to provide accurate predictions, with an intuitive interface that includes a dark mode option and responsive design for seamless use across devices.
Users can input their measurements, get an instant body fat estimate, and reference a body fat chart for context.
This project demonstrates the integration of a modern React frontend with a FastAPI backend, focusing on usability, performance, and clean design
