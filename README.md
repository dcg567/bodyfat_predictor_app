# Body Fat Prediction Web Application 

An interactive web application that predicts body fat percentage based on user input measurements using a Decision Tree Regressor.
Built with React (frontend) and FastAPI (backend), this project demonstrates full-stack development, machine learning integration, and responsive UI with dark mode support.

Features
	•	Body Fat Prediction using a machine learning model.
	•	Responsive Design – Works on desktop and mobile.
	•	Dark Mode Toggle for a modern UI.
	•	Interactive UI with instant feedback.
	•	Visual Body Fat Chart for quick interpretation.
	•	Built with React + FastAPI + Scikit-learn.
